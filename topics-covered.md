- [x] Storing JSX values in react state
- [x] storing JSX values in variables
- [x] Updating local state when prop changes with useEffect
- [x] useEffect(() => setState(prop), [prop]); // use redux or data-down, change up approach
- [x] Using prop destructured value in useEffect dependency array
- [x] Huge component trees
- [x] Components should not be tightly coupled, they should be independently re-usable
- [x] Separation of concerns (tightly coupled components, redux implementation)
- [x] Single Responsibility
- [x] Nested components
- [x] In JSX loops, using item index or random numbers as the key of the item.
- [x] Contradicting states, e.g. isError, isLoading
- [x] Abusive states, when the data can be derived from existing states
- [x] Memoize heavy calculations
- [x] Never define constants inside the components, it can cause performance issue (sometimes visible lags)
- [x] Storing everything in redux, connecting form inputs directly to redux will have heavy performance issue. Only use redux for truly global states
- [x] User Propfile page: do not reset all the states in a useEffect when the userId changes. Source: react docs beta
- [x] Handle race conditions
